## Week 2 Homework: Assessing Security Culture 

This week we learned about security culture and how to promote it within organizations. 

It’s important that all employees are aware of common security risks and treat security seriously. The majority of cyberattacks aim to exploit human weaknesses with methods like phishing. 

For this reason, people are most often the weakest link in an organization’s security defenses. 

### Scenario

- Employees at SilverCorp are increasingly using their own personal devices for company work. 

- Specifically, over half of all employees check their work email and communications via Slack on their personal mobile phones. 

- Another 25% of employees are doing other work-related activities using work accounts and work-related applications on their personal phone.

- Allowing sensitive work information to be shared on employees’ personal devices has a number of security implications. 

- You must research these security risks and use the security culture framework to develop a plan to mitigate the concerns.

### Instructions

Compose the answers to the following four steps in a Google Doc.

#### Step 1: Measure and Set Goals 

Answer the following questions:

1. Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.

Answer: 

        - Lost or stolen devices

            According to research from Ponemon Institute, 39% of the study participants reported that their organizations had a data security breach, which was a consequence of a stolen device. 

        - Malware
            In 2012 Jupitor Networks reported a 155% increase in the malacious software developed by hackers for mobile devices, specifically Android (Increase by 3325%)

        - Identity theft via weak links in the Friends and Family
            The US Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network found that in about 27% of the suspicious activity reports, the person victim of the identity theft knew the suspected thief who was usually a famiy member, friend, acquaintance or an employee working in a victim's home. 





2. Based on the above scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior? 
    - For example, if employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, the preferred behavior would be that employees only download attachments from trusted sources. 

Answer:

- For the potential risks listed above, the preferred Behaviour is as follows:
      - Lost or stolen devices correction: Use encripted devices. Ideally the company should work on policies and work environment to such an extent that the employee does not have to work from home. However this may not be achievable in every situation and some professions necessitate the employees to work from home. The company can then have a policy to issue encrypted secure laptops/computers issued to the employees. Alternatively, the company can have the policy to encrypt an employee's personal laptop or device. The employee can be given a choice whether to use the company issued enctypted laptop or have their own laptop/mobile enctypted


 - Increased protection from malware: Installing an anti-malware on their personal devices. The company can offer employees to install latest anti-malware software on their personal devices as part of the benifits package for working in the company

- Increasing awareness: The corrective employee behaviour would be to be congnizant of the ways they are vulnerable to identify theft by sharing real world data such as the researh conducted by the US Treasurey Department



3. What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently _not_ behaving according to the preferred behavior? 
    - For example, conduct a survey to see how often people download email attachments from unknown senders. 

Answer:
   - I will utilize the Information security culture framework (ISCF) as originally porposed by Alhogail and colleagues which is composed of five dimentions including strategy, Technology, Organization, People and Environment (STOPE) and will target the 4 main factors of human factor diamond which include: Preparedness, Responsibility, Management, Society and Regulations. My assessment instrument will be a questionare to collect data from employees regarding their believes, perceptions, knowledge and practice towards information security. The survery will target two specific components 

   1) The demographic infomration of the employees e-g, age group, education, background, Job title, information technology use and experience. 

   2) Obtaining assessment regarding the information security behaviour, perceptions and knowledge about IT. Prior studies have demonstrated that the employee's knowledge about IT positiavely co-relates with the 



4. What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior? 
    - For example, to have less than 5% of employees downloading suspicious email attachments. 
    
    Answer:
    
    The goal will depend on the results of the survery. A roubust statiscal analysis will be preformed to determine reliability and validity of the assessment instrument. The reliability will be assessed by analyzing the cronbach alpha as a measure of internal consistency, with a minimum set to at least above 0.6 for acceptability. The validity will be measured using the goodness of fit. (0.9 as acceptable and 0.95+ as good fit)

    Once the assessment instrument has been determined to have acceptable reliability and validity. The goal would be to reduce the number of employees using personal devices to initially achieve 50% reduction in the exising practice and eventually to a rate of less than 5% overall. There will also be an 80% or above pass rate requirement for the employees in the information security quizzes. 




#### Step 2: Involve the Right People 

Now that you have a goal in mind, who needs to be involved?  

- Indicate at least five employees or departments that need to be involved. For each person or department, indicate in 2-3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be. 


Five People to involve

 - Chief Executive Officer of the company
     Role: 
     -Providing information regardig the existing state of the company. 
     -Bringing all involved parties to the table including the COO, Chief of staff, Chief financial officer 
     -Providing resources for executing the proposed plan e-g buying anti-malware software, new encrypted laptops for the employees

 - Chief Information Officer of the Company
    Role:
    - Implementing the techological aspects of the cybersecurity porposed plan, e-g installing malwares, upgrading OS, encrypting employee's phones or laptops
    - Conducting surveys  for the aassessment of security culture, conducting quality control studies for repeat assessment of whether the company is achieving the set milestones and goals for the implementation of the security policy

 - Board of Directors
    - Inccorporating the proposed security culture policies into the company policies and starategy in combating insecure employee practices

 - Chief Operating officer
     - Communicating the policy changes to the employees
     - Training the employees against the security threats by creating awareness courses- such as awareness regarding the mechanisms of identity theft
     

 - Chief of Staff
    - Hiering new personel as needed for implementing the new security culture- such as new IT specialists. Appointing a chief information security officer (CISO)

 - Chief Financial Officer
    - Determining the financial feasibility in instituting the new company policies. For example determining whether the company can afford to issue new encrypted phones or laptops to the employees. 



#### Step 3: Training Plan 

Training is part of any security culture framework plan. How will you train your employees on this security concern? In one page, indicate the following:

* How frequently will you run training? What format will it take? (i.e. in-person, online, a combination of both)

Answer:
    Initially a survey will be conducted to assess the knowledge base of the existing employees. The results of the survey will be analyzed for reliabiliy and validity. The foramt of the training will be composed on both inperson interactive sessions and online learning. The Company's leadership will be directly involved. The inperson sessions will include participation by the company's leadership to emphasized the security policies. More specific topic will be targeted with remote online learning. At the current time, due to COVID even the initialy inperson session will be conduted in the form of live Zoom sessions
    Every new employee who joins the institution will have to complete the courses/live sessions as a mandatory requirement before starting with duties. Some training courses will be broad based creating general awareness, others will be targeted by specific areas of vulnerability as outlined below. The general courses will be repeated every year. Specific topic courses will be available every 6 months with updated data. 



* What topics will you cover in your training and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)

  The live zoom session will be a welcome orientation as well as the 1st mandatory traning session regarding cybersecurity policies of the company. The companies leadership will participate in the live session including the Chief information security officer, chief information officer, Chief operations manager and if feasible the companie's CEO. This session will emphasize companies policies in the cybersecurity culture. The topics will include:

  1) State of the company: The designated officials will share statistics regarding the companies employee's and the risk of cybersecurity threats. Any relevant data regarding the past incidents will also be shared.

  2) Emphasizing the companies culture that cybersecurity is "everyone's responsibility"

  3) Information regarding who to contact and report if an employee suspects a data breach, recieves a suspiscious e-mail etc. 

  4) Introduction to reward programs for compliance with the cybersecurity policies or reporting incidents. 


  In addition to the inperson/live sessions, the employees will also take additional course to create awareness on specific catefories of cybersecurity insults

  1) Phishing scams: Emphasizing not to click unfamiliar links in external e-mail. Emphasizing the the company's adminstration will never ask the employee's to directly provide password etc

  2) Information regarding the common types of hacking tricks such as malware, ransomware, formjacking, code injection, brut force with examples of data breaches with other companies 

  3) Online training with the installation of anti-malware software on the employee's personal devices

  4) Certain employees maybe more vulnerable, especially if they need to routinely perform work related activities from home. For example residents who need to obtain access to electronic medical records of patients from home. Such employees may be better off with using company's issued divices with secure incription at home. An alternative will be encrypting the employee's personal devices (if they are willing ) for remote work. 

  5) The emyployees will be educated regarding the 2 factor identification to prevent identity theft. The online training will inform the employees with examples regarding the mechanisms of identity theft along with videos of how to set this up at the start of their employment

  6) The employees will be educated about the company's policies of not using external USB, how to obtain encryted USBs for work that maybe issued by the company if needed.

  7) The training will also include information regarding the alternatives to using personal devices at work such as remote desktop connection, working on the server that is protected against a firewall rather than personal computer for any data related activity. Using encrypted USBs issued by the company rather than the external USBs.

  8) Adopting common sense measures including logging out before leaving a computer, Limiting access to confidential information on a need to know basis. Not disclosing protected information on social media. Reporting incidents of potential data breaches e-g lost or stolen laptop 

  
* After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness? 

The effectiveness of the cybersecurity culture framework will be assessed by evaluating the three dimentions

- Measuring awareness:
    This will include results of the quizes, participation level in the training programs. Testing employee's knowledge by conducting surveys and comparing results for before and after training using the same survey. Another method is by assessing employee feeback 

- Measuring behabiour: 
   This can be achieved by simulating phishing attacks and measurig how many employees fell into the trap. 

- Measuring culture:
  Performaing qualitative analysis to determine the culture of the institution by reviewing patient's feedback. Identifying recurrent topics and obtaining a sense how seriously do the employees take the cybersecurity threats. Determine whether these preceptions have changed with the implementation of new policies. I would conduct these qualitative cybersecurity culture analysis on a yearly basis.
